      <h3>What's the Story?</h3>
      <p>This photo was taken in the town of Interlaken, Switzerland. My sister and I took this trip the summer after my senior year of high school when she was studying abroad in Florence. Our trip to Interlaken lasted 4 days, and this picture was one of my favorites from the trip because I really love the colors and the overall aesthetic. The picture is really simple, but it means a lot to me.</p>

      <h3>What's the Story?</h3>
      <p>My sister and I took a trip to Jungfraujach on our second-to-last day in Interlaken. My grandparents had gone here before and suggested we take a trip up. However, as my sister and I had completely self-funded our trip, we were really trying to save money and couldn't afford to take the train up (we had already been eating oatmeal and frozen pizzas our whole trip). Luckily, our grandparents paid for us to see the area because they loved it so much! I am so grateful for their generosity! This place is known as "the top of Europe."</p>

      <h3>What's the Story?</h3>
      <p>Our whole day was spent at the top of Jungfraujach. We just couldn't get enough of it. I had never experienced anything like it. My sister and I threw snowballs, took pictures and just sat in the snow talking and laughing for hours. The cold didn't even affect us because we were so awestruck. We finally had to leave at the end of the day when we started getting altitude sickness and Sam thought she was going to throw up and pass out simultaneously.</p>
